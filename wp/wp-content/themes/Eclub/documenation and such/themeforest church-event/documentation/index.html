<p>On rare occasions our themes may not be install properly.
If you have any issues with installing the theme, you might want to first check the <a href="http://support.vamtam.com/solution/categories/2296/folders/4759">basic troubleshooting page</a> .

				<hr class="notop" />




<p>Once you have activated a VamTam theme, you will be directed to the page Quick Import and you will see the theme's menu- VamTam in the Wp main navigation menu on the left. At the top you will see the following warning:</p>

This theme recommends the following plugins: Love it (Maintained by Vamtam), MailPoet Newsletters (formerly Wysija), The Events Calendar, WP Retina 2x and WooCommerce.<br/>

This theme requires the following plugins:: Layered Slider Contact Form 7 and Vamtam Push Menu.
Begin installing plugins | Dismiss this notice <br/><br/>

The buttons of the importer will not be active until you install Contact Form 7, LayerSlider WP and Vamtam Push Menu., so please click on "begin installing plugin". The recommended plugins are optional and there is no need to install them if you do not intend to use them.




<p><b>Quick Import? How does it Help Me?</b></p>


This is a great feature that helps novice WordPress users and veterans alike. This feature makes the necessary settings/configurations and installs demo content in the WordPress theme: categories, pages, posts and widgets.<br/>

Your VamTam theme will look exactly like the one you see on our live preview . It doesn't matter if you know WordPress inside out or seen it for the first time, it's always easier to modify posts, categories, pages and widgets that are already there rather then creating them from scratch. Moreover it is easier to understand how your new VamTam theme works.<br/>
Our Quick Import is a tremendous feature that will save you a lot of frustration and headache at a press of a button. Try it out. We promise you won’t be disappointed.<br/>
You can access the feature from your WordPress admin panel:<br/>
WP navigation menu =&gt; VamTam =&gt; Quick Import<br/>
Please note that the dummy content doesn't come with the original images due to copyright restrictions. You will need to add your images manually.<br/>
You will notice that widgets, content and Layered Slider demo slides can be imported separately.<p>Click on Save Changes.




<p><b>Logo</b></p>




<p>Using a Text Logo</p>




<ol>
<li>Go to Settings =&gt; General in the WordPress left side navigation menu.</li>
<li>Locate the Site Title item.</li>
<li>Change it to what you like.</li>
<li>Click the "Save Changes" button.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using an Image as a Logo</p>




<ol>
<li>Please go to General Settings in the VamTam theme left side navigation menu.</li>
<li>Locate the "Custom Logo Picture" and upload your logo.</li>
<li>Click the "Save Changes" button.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Menu</b></p>




<p>WordPress automatically creates a menu of your pages for you, but the Custom Menu feature gives you complete control of what appears in the menu, where it appears and also the menu title. Many times the page title you want to use will take up big part of the width of your header where the navigation menu appears. Custom menu allows you to shorten or totally change the name that appears in the navigation.</p>


We use Custom Menus feature in all our themes. If you haven't imported the demo content, you have to create one.<br/>

<p><b>Drag and Drop Page Builder</b></p>
The Drag and Drop Page Builder is based on the popular visual composer and those that know Visual Composer well may no need to read further.<br/>
Above the text editor in the top right side you will notice three tabs - Visual, Text, VamTam. By default Vamtam tab - the Drag &amp; Drop page builder will be loaded.<br/>

Once the element is inserted you will see its block into the builder. Now you can change the width of the element, change its position relative to the other elements( if there are more than one), delete, clone or edit it by using the buttons that are located in the left and right side of the shortcode block. You can insert elements into some of the other elements - tabs,accordion, column / color box work this way.<br/>
You do not need to use the column/color box shortcode unless the layout is very complex, as the width of the elements is controlled by buttons +/- located on each element.<br/>
Please note that some of the element's blocks have a toggle on the right side.<br/>
You can open them directly in the builder and edit the text.<br/>

The theme comes with&nbsp;<b>Layered Slider.</b>&nbsp;<p>We always recommend importing the demo content. If you have done so you would have imported the sample sliders that come with the theme and replicate the one on the demo website. You can use these sliders as a starting point for your own website. The "sample sliders" are well designed and complex sliders. If you are not yet familiar with the slider and theme options it is a must to use them.&nbsp;Layered slider is powerful and complex parallax slider. It gives you unlimited opportunities to create slides with many sub layers with different animation.Please note that the Layered Slider is a plugin and have its own option panel found in the main left side navigation menu - Layered Slider WP</p>

<br>
<h3>1. How To Install WooCommerce And Setup The Default Shop Pages</h3>

</ul>
<br><br><p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Once you are done installing WooCommerce and the default pages, you can go to the <strong>Appearance &gt; Menu</strong>
section of your admin and choose to add all the WooCommerce pages to
your menu. They will be listed at the top under the most recent pages</p>
<br><br><p><img style="cursor: default;" src="http://cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/14432446/original/image2.png?1386852072" class="inline-image" data-id="14432446"></p>
<br><h4>2. How To Create Your Products</h4>
<br><ul class="marginleft">
<li>Click on the <strong>Products</strong> sidebar menu</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Add Product</strong> button at the top of the page.</li>
<li>Enter a name for your product at the top of the page</li>
<li>Enter all the product description text into the post content field, this will be all the product informaiton</li>
<li>The <strong>Product Data</strong> box is where you enter all the product details (price, SKU, shipping, and more)</li>

<br><br><h4>3. How To Use WooCommerce Shortcodes With Do.Biz Columns And Have The Graphics Extend The Full Width of The Column</h4>
<br><p>WooComerce shortcodes can be used with Do.Biz columns and the
graphics will extend out the full width of the column size. But this
will only happen once you have a large enough Catalog image size and you
might possibly need to regenerate thumbnails using the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/">Regenerate Thumbnails</a> plugin. This is very important in having a consistent design/layout for all your pages.
<br><br><br></p>
<p><img style="cursor: default;" src="http://cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/14432468/original/image4.png?1386852116" class="inline-image" data-id="14432468"></p>
<br><ul class="marginleft">
<li>Click on the <strong>WooCommerce</strong> sidebar menu item and find <strong>Settings</strong> area</li>
<li>Click on&nbsp;<b>Catalog</b>&nbsp;tab at the top of the page.</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the Catalog tab and find the <strong>Image Options</strong> section</li>
<li>There is a <strong>Catalog, Single Product &amp; Product Thumbnail</strong> image size</li>
<li>
<strong>Catalog Image </strong> is for your images on the shop page and for shortcodes.</li>
<li>
<strong>Single Product Image </strong> is for your images on the single product pages</li>
<li>
<strong>Product Thumbnail</strong> is for your smaller product thumbnails for widgets</li>
<li>If you want your image to not be cropped leave the height field blank and only enter a width </li>
<li>Enter a large enough Catalog Image Width to fit the corresponding column size.</li>
<li>When you make changes to the 3 various images sizes and save it, you may need to regenerate thumbnails using the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/">Regenerate Thumbnails</a> plugin</li>
<li>Install the Regenerate Thumbnails plugin and go to your
media section and choose to regenerate your image thumbnails so the
larger size will be created</li>
</ul>
<br><p><strong>Please Note: </strong> Your catalog image size and
single product image size need to be large enough to fit the size column
you want to use. And you also need to make sure your product images are
the size you need. For example: if you want to use a shortcode in a
one_half column and have it fill the full space, then you need to have a
Catalog Image size of about 500px in width, and your product image
needs to be at least 500px.</p>

</div>
<br>
<p><b>Posting a ticket in the Help Desk</b></p>
<p>In order to post a ticket in the Help Desk,
the support team need to verify that you are our customer. Please provide the
Item Purchase Code if you have installed the theme on a localhost. If the theme
is installed on a Public Server you will need to enter the purchase code in the admin
panel - general settings - the tab "purchase" and only provide the
url of your installation.</p>
<p>To
obtain the &nbsp;Item Purchase Code login to your ThemeForest
account that was used to purchase the theme with. Click on your
"Downloads" section and then click on "License certificate and purchase
code". This will prompt you to either open or save a text file

<br><br><p><b>Contextual
Help Documentation
integrated into WordPress contextual help</b></p>
This theme extends WordPress contextual help with many useful
topics. If you get stuck using the
theme, please check this source first. If the topic is not displayed in
contextual help, you may also visit this User
Manual.<br><p>To access contextual help simply hoover over the "Help" balloon bellow the titles of each
option .</p>
<br><br><p><b>Support Channels </b></p>
<p>VamTam provides theme related support via our Help Desk,
knowledge-base &amp; video tutorials.&nbsp;</p>
<br><br><p><b>Why not a Support Forum?</b></p>
<p>Simply put, so we can offer you superior support.</p>
<p>A forum works only when you have a large enough active community -
thousands of people willing to participate on a daily basis. The smaller
the community, the more likely you are to wait for a long time before
someone answers your question. Unfortunately even the top authors in Themeforest have only a few hundreds active users on a daily basis and this is not enough to make the forum works</p>
<br><br><p><b>Why not the Themeforest Comment Board?</b></p>
<p>1.The access to the Themeforest account is restricted only to the account holder and the support team cannot get involved.</p>
<p>2.It is difficult to track the communication.</p>
<p>3.You can't send sensitive information - ftp/admin credentials.</p>
<br><br><p><b style="">Support Hours</b></p>
<p>Our general support hours are Monday to Friday, 0 - 24h. During this
time, we can generally provide feedback on any support queries within 8 - 24 hours, whilst we will also commit to answer any queries during
weekends and holidays within 24-36 hours.</p>
<br><br><p><b>Extent of our Support </b></p>
<p>All of our items come with free support, and we have a dedicated support team to handle your requests.&nbsp;<b><br></b></p>
<p>We only cover support for our themes, and cannot give general
WordPress support that isn't related to our themes. For general
WordPress support you will have to use <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/support">www.WordPress.org/support</a></p>
<p>We are not able to provide support for code customizations or third-party plugins.&nbsp;We understand that there is a fine line between what is considered
support &amp; modifications. So whilst we will try to help you with any
type of query (support or modification), we cannot provide extensive
help in terms of modifications. Technical support will thus take
priority over modification support.&nbsp;</p>

<br><p><b>Definition of Modification Support </b></p>
<p>If you are requesting modification help, which only requires us to
publish a couple lines of code, we will be glad to assist you. If
however your query requires more than that amount of code to be
published, we can only provide guidance and you would then need to hire a
developer if you don't have the skills to implement it yourself.</p>
<br><br><p><b>Bug Fixing </b></p>
<p>It is our commitment to fix all theme bugs as quickly as possible
after they are brought to our attention. During our general support
hours, we can fix bugs within 24 - 48 hours.</p>
